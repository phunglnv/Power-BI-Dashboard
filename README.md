# Buidling Dashboard about GDP & Life Expectancy by country in 2022

As a part of learning process, I use Power BI to connect, transform and visualize the data on this project.  


## Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from World Population Review as CSV file.

## Clean and Transform the data 
- First, create table from orginal data. 
- To see the relationships with life expectancy, I use "Data - Geography" from Excel to get information of any countries. 
- Finally, I generate the number of years into text and save it in a different file.
